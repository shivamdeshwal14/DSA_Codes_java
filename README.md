1. stack is implemented using array
2. stack is implemented using queue
3. stack is implemented using LinkedList (perform push and pop  operation in the begining to reduce complexity)
4.Queue using linked list is adding elements in begining of linkedlist in 0(1).
and removing element from end in O(n) complexity
